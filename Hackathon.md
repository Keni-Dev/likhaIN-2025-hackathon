## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### Must-Do's:

1. **Working Demo** - Even if simple, it MUST work
2. **Clear Problem-Solution Fit** - Don't build solutions looking for problems
3. **Practice Presentation** - Minimum 5 full run-throughs

5. **Professional Appearance** - Dress well, clean design, confident delivery

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:

❌ Over-ambitious scope - too many features
❌ Ignoring the workshops - they give hints about judging
❌ Poor time management - rushing the presentation
❌ Technical demos that fail - always have backups
❌ Not testing on the presentation computer
❌ Forgetting to submit required materials
❌ All-nighters without strategic napping (rotate rest)
❌ Not understanding the actual problem presented

## TEAM COORDINATION STRATEGY

### Communication Protocol:

**Use a group chat (Messenger/Discord) with these channels:**
- #general - general updates
- #code - technical discussions
- #design - UI/UX feedback
- #presentation - pitch development
- #standup - hourly check-ins

**Hourly Standups (2 minutes each):**
- What did you complete?
- What are you working on next?
- Any blockers?

### Git Workflow:

```
main (production)
├── dev (development)
    ├── feature/frontend-ui
    ├── feature/backend-api
    ├── feature/integration
    └── feature/third-party
```

**Rules:**
- Never push directly to main
- Commit every hour
- Clear commit messages
- Pull before pushing
- Test before merging
